# Pietro's "IT-knowledgeBase"

Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Pietro, a 31-year-old tech enthusiast from Italy.

This Repository is my personal knowledge-base. Here you'll find code-snippets, technical documentation, and command reference for various tools, and technologies.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases.
